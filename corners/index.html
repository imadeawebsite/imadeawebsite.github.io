	<h1>the corners</h1>
	<p>the next step is to solve the four white corners (by white I mean your top layer colour). 
	now, im going to teach
	you some quick notation. so R means right, L means left, U means up (top layer) D means down (bottom layer) and F means front. every turn should be clockwise if you were facing it. 
	if a letter is followed by a little i, it is counter clockwise. if a letter is followed by a 2 turn the side 180 degrees instead of 90.
	anyway, find a corner and the place on the top layer it goes and put that corner under the place it goes (so the equivalent place on the bottom layer.) then, turn the cube 
	so the white sticker on the corner is facing you (unless its on the bottom, in which case hang in there). then, do whichever D move (clockwise or counterclockwise) will 
	move the peice so that its still on the front layer (so if its on your right move it left). then do Ri, then the opposite D move then the one you did at the beginning, then R.
	if the white sticker is on the bottom, do Ri D2 R D, then solve like i said above.</p>
